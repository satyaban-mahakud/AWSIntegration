#  Account Factory 
##  Overview

  Account Factory is a key feature of AWS Control Tower that automates the provisioning of new AWS accounts. It ensures that these accounts are created with pre-approved configurations, adhering to your organization’s policies and standards1.
###  Key Components

####  AWS Service Catalog:

  Account Factory leverages AWS Service Catalog to manage and provision accounts. It uses pre-defined templates (products) to ensure consistency and compliance across all new accounts1.
####  AWS IAM Identity Center:

  AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS Single Sign-On) is integrated with Account Factory to manage user access and permissions. This ensures that users have the appropriate access to the accounts they need1.
####  AWS Organizations:

  Account Factory works within the AWS Organizations framework, allowing you to create and manage multiple accounts under a single organization. This helps in maintaining a structured and secure environment1.
##  Features

  Account Factory automates the creation of new AWS accounts, reducing the manual effort and time required. This automation ensures that all new accounts are compliant with your organization’s standards from the start1.
###  Pre-Approved Configurations:

  When provisioning new accounts, Account Factory uses pre-approved configurations defined in AWS Service Catalog products. This ensures that all accounts are set up consistently and adhere to best practices1.
